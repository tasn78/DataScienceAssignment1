Dataset Overview:

This dataset contains information from 10 female participants used for analyzing frailty. The dataset includes physical measurements such as Height, Weight, Age, and Grip strength, as well as a Frailty label indicating whether the participant exhibits frailty symptoms (Y for frail, N for non-frail). The data is used to explore correlations between grip strength and frailty, with the aim of understanding how reduced grip strength relates to higher frailty scores.
Data Columns:

    Height:
        Type: Numeric (Inches)
        Description: The height of the participant in inches.

    Weight:
        Type: Numeric (Pounds)
        Description: The weight of the participant in pounds.

    Age:
        Type: Numeric (Years)
        Description: The age of the participant in years.

    Grip strength:
        Type: Numeric (Kilograms)
        Description: The maximum static force the participant can exert on a hand-held dynamometer, measured in kilograms.

    Frailty:
        Type: Categorical (String)
        Description: Indicates the frailty status of the participant.
            Y: Frail
            N: Non-frail

File Details:

    File Name: Frailty_data_raw.csv
    Number of Records: 10 rows
    Number of Columns: 5 columns (Height, Weight, Age, Grip strength, Frailty)

Purpose:

The dataset is designed to analyze the relationship between grip strength and frailty, as well as explore how various physical characteristics such as height, weight, and age may be associated with frailty in female participants.
Usage:

This dataset can be used for:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine distributions and correlations between variables.
    Building classification models to predict frailty based on physical characteristics.
    Visualizing the relationships between grip strength and frailty.

Additional Notes:

    All data in this file is based on a sample size of 10 female participants.
    The dataset is intended for use in research, education, and analysis of frailty prediction.
